After 8 years apprenticing around the world, Martha set out as a self-funded, first generation winemaker to answer the question, “What does California taste like?” In our hot little corner of Northern California, Mediterranean grapes thrive and healthy vineyards allow us to create joyful balanced wines. Our wines are made from unexpected varietals and offer new takes on California classics. We do things the right way even if it's not the easy or cool way. Of the dozen or so wines we make every year, blends and flavors change but our desire to share the simple pleasures of natural wine remains the same.<\/p>"

She was thrilled to find a handful of dedicated farmers, primarily growing Mediterranean grapes in the Ukiah area of Mendocino County, Contra Costa County and Suisun Valley. She has been making wine from their fruit and laughing with them ever since. Martha also found two traditionally planted, head trained, dry farmed vineyards that she now leases, allowing us to farm 25% of our production. <\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p>Wine is an agricultural product. Just as with food, highly processed wines contain additives to mask flavor deficiencies in the base ingredient: grapes. And poorly farmed grapes (read: cheap farming that’s bad for our soils) will always need this flavor boost. Why apply harmful pesticides and herbicides when we know this kills soil microbiology, the very thing that assists in plant nutrition and grape flavor? In the vineyard we farm for healthy soils and vine longevity rather than high yields. We allow predatory insects the ability to outcompete pests rather than spraying insecticides, and do proper handwork to ensure healthy grapes come into the cellar ready to make flavorful, honest wines.<\/p>"

Instead of using a single commercial yeast species, we embrace native fermentations and the many flavors a diversity of microbes bring to our wines. <\/p><p>In the cellar we strive to create the conditions for the natural process of fermentation to thrive. Rather than trying to tightly control the transition from grapes to wine from within the juice, we prepare with rigorous cellar cleaning. From there we intimately monitor every fermentation. We work with our hands, feet, and our own human energy to bring these wines to life, and are energized by this process. Harvest heals, excites, inspires, and connects us every year.<\/p>"
