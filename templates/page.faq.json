Each Monday morning, a refrigerated FedEx truck arrives at our warehouse and picks up all of the orders from the past week. Everyone’s wine is sent out to regional temperature controlled facilities, and delivered the following week. It’s not fast! But it’s also significantly cheaper than overnight shipping, and has a smaller (though not insignificant!) carbon footprint. <\/p>"
